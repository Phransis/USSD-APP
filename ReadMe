This is a simple USSSD App built with Python
Before you start anything else make sure you read this ReadMe file thoroughly 
If you're reading this in the future, some libraries may not be compartible due to updates
Make sure you search the the incompartible library in the pypi.org for newer versions and read the documaentation

___START___
Clone this code and go through the code
Go to www.ngrok.com and download ngrok, install and run it, a command line would pop up
Run Ngrok in the terminal using the following command "ngrok https 8000"
In the terminal you would see "Forwarding", copy the url assigned to it and paste it in the "ALLOWED_HOST=["url link from ngrok"]" in the settings.py file
Create an account and login, run the command line code in the installation guideline in the already running ngrok terminal 
A Url would be generated for you which can be found in the "Authtoken" panel  copy the Url ---Make sure you copy and paste the Url somewhere, it would be needed later---
Create an account on www.africastalking.com and and switch to sandbox mode 
Navigate to the USSD in the dashboard and Click Create channel 
This will take you to a page where you will create your own USSD service code
Fill in the details, paste the Url you generated on the ngrok dashboard in the "Callback url" box then submit
Run "python manage.py runserver" in your code editor
Login to africastalking.com, click on "Launch simulator" to test your new USSD app

NB: Anytime the ngrok terminal is restarted, you'd have to 
1. change the ALLOWED_HOST url to the url in the ngrok terminal
2. Login to ngrok.com and refresh your Authtoken page and copy the new url
3. Login to africastalking.com and change the callback url of USSD channel to the new url from ngrok.com
